# leptos-lnc-test

This minimal test is based on the [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) 'counter' example. Like 'counter' it's a client side rendered app with Rust and WASM. In the folder `static` it contains the JS and WASM files needed for [Lightning Node Connect](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-node-connect). 

To run it, just issue the `trunk serve --open` command in the example root. This will build the app, run it, and open a new browser to serve it.
